# Side project template

This repository is a template for any side project you might want to start.
It is useful for example if you're making a website for an event. 
Some examples from the past where such a template would be useful are:

- A website for Thalia's Symposium
- A website for the introduction week.

This template contains the following stuff:

- A [Terraform](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform) configuration to manage cloud infrastructure on AWS.
